# scripts

I am not good at scripting (yet) so these won't be great but hopefully they will at least work

* cewl.sh - Takes a list of websites and creates a unique wordlist from them all
(basically a wrapper for cewl as I couldn't find an option to take multiple wensites to crawl)

* nmapv1.sh - Can't remember what this is, something stupid

* string_chk.py - Searches the rockyou password breach file and returns any matches to the requested string

* passwd_chk.py - You update a password policy (i.e. minimum characters and special/numbers etc.) and it returns the amount of passwords that match. 
(I thought this might help show how insecure some password policies are but now I am not so sure)
